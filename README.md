This repository demonstrates a common error in Ada: stack overflow due to unbounded recursion.  The `factorial_bug.ada` file contains a recursive factorial function that lacks proper handling of large inputs, causing a stack overflow.  The `factorial_solution.ada` file provides a corrected version using iteration to avoid this issue.  This example highlights the importance of considering resource limitations when implementing recursive algorithms in Ada.
